R code to accompany:
Disentangling the Impacts of Microtopography and Shrub Distribution on Snow Depth in a Sub-Arctic Watershed: Toward a Predictive Understanding of Snow Spatial Variability

Input maps (snow depth, surface elevation, distance from 1m+ vegetation, vegetation 
height) are provided in  the data folder for the analysis described in the accompanying paper. Note that these maps are saved in .txt format - other formats would require modifying the code. 

Some of the outputs files are large - if the code is applied to larger domains, the input/output file structure would need to be modified.

The code for the boosted regression tree analysis is taken from:
Elith, Jane, John R. Leathwick, and Trevor Hastie. "A working guide to boosted regression trees." Journal of animal ecology 77.4 (2008): 802-813.
